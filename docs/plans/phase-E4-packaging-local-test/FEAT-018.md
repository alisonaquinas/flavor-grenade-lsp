# VSIX Packaging and Local Verification

> [!INFO] `FEAT-018` · Feature · Phase E4 · Priority: `high` · Status: `draft`

## Goal

The Flavor Grenade extension is packaged into a distributable VSIX file that contains all required Marketplace assets — a user-facing README, changelog, license, and icon — and can be installed locally into VS Code for end-to-end verification. When this feature is complete, a vault author can install the VSIX, open an Obsidian vault, and confirm that completions, diagnostics, commands, and the status bar all work correctly on their machine.

---

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Creating Marketplace-facing `extension/README.md` with features, configuration table, and getting started instructions
- Creating `extension/CHANGELOG.md` with the 0.1.0 unreleased entry
- Copying `LICENSE` from the repo root into the extension directory
- Creating a 256x256 placeholder icon at `extension/images/icon.png`
- Building the server binary for the host platform with `bun build --compile --minify`
- Building the extension client with `npm run build:extension`
- Packaging the VSIX with `npx vsce package`
- Inspecting the VSIX to confirm only shipping files are included
- Installing the VSIX locally and performing a manual smoke test
- Verifying `.vscodeignore` excludes all non-shipping files

**Out of scope (explicitly excluded):**

- Publishing to the VS Code Marketplace (deferred to CI/CD phase)
- Cross-platform binary bundling and multi-target builds (CI matrix concern)
- Automated integration tests for the packaged extension
- Signing the VSIX

## Linked User Requirements

> User requirements are implementation-agnostic goals from the vault author's perspective. Source: [[requirements/user/index]].

| User Req Tag | Goal | Source File |
|---|---|---|
| — | Vault author can install the extension from a VSIX and use all LSP features in VS Code | [[requirements/user/index]] |

---

## Linked Functional Requirements

> Planguage requirements that this feature must satisfy. Source: [[requirements/index]].

| Planguage Tag | Gist | Source File |
|---|---|---|
| — | Packaging and distribution; functional requirements addressed by earlier phases | [[requirements/index]] |

---

## Linked BDD Features

> Gherkin feature files whose scenarios constitute the acceptance test surface for this feature.

| Feature File | Description |
|---|---|
| — | N/A — packaging verification is a manual smoke test, not a BDD scenario. The gate is a successful local install and manual confirmation of completions, diagnostics, commands, and status bar. |

## Phase Plan Reference

- Phase plan: [[plans/phase-E4-packaging-local-test]]
- Execution ledger row: [[plans/execution-ledger]]

## Acceptance Criteria

All of the following must be true before this ticket is marked `done`. The LLM agent checks each item when transitioning to `in-review`.

- [ ] `extension/README.md` exists with features, configuration table, and getting started sections
- [ ] `extension/CHANGELOG.md` exists with 0.1.0 unreleased entry
- [ ] `extension/LICENSE` exists and matches repo root LICENSE
- [ ] `extension/images/icon.png` exists and is at least 128x128 PNG
- [ ] `npx vsce package` produces a `.vsix` file without errors
- [ ] VSIX contains only shipping files (dist/, server/, package.json, README.md, LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md, images/)
- [ ] VSIX does not contain src/, node_modules/, tsconfig.json, *.ts source, or *.test.* files
- [ ] `code --install-extension` installs the VSIX successfully
- [ ] Manual smoke test confirms: extension activates, status bar shows indexing state, completions work, commands work
- [ ] All child tasks (TASK-147, TASK-148) and chore (CHORE-042) are in `done` state

---

## Child Tasks

> List all `TASK-NNN` tickets that implement this feature. Create the task tickets before beginning implementation.

| Ticket | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [[TASK-147]] | Add Marketplace assets (README, CHANGELOG, LICENSE, icon) | `open` |
| [[TASK-148]] | Package VSIX and run end-to-end local smoke test | `open` |
| [[CHORE-042]] | Verify .vscodeignore excludes all non-shipping files | `open` |

---

## Dependencies

> Tickets or phases that must complete before this feature can start, and tickets that this feature unblocks.

**Blocked by:**

- [[FEAT-017]] — Phase E3 (Status Bar & Commands) must be complete before packaging can begin. The extension must have all client features implemented before VSIX packaging.

**Unblocks:**

- Phase E5 / CI publishing — once local verification passes, the extension is ready for automated cross-platform builds and Marketplace publishing.

---

## Notes

This phase is the final local verification gate before the extension enters CI/CD pipelines. The build steps intentionally omit `--bytecode` (a CI-only optimization for faster startup) and `--target` (compiles for host platform only). Cross-platform builds are handled in the CI delivery phase.

The VSIX internal path prefix `extension/` is added by `vsce` and is distinct from the repo's `extension/` directory. When inspecting VSIX contents, paths like `extension/dist/extension.js` refer to the VSIX root, not the repo structure.

## Lifecycle

Full state machine, entry/exit criteria, and agent obligations for each state: [[templates/tickets/lifecycle/feature-lifecycle]]

**State path:** `draft` → `ready` → `in-progress` → `in-review` → `done`
**Lateral states:** `blocked` (from `in-progress`), `cancelled` (from any state)

| State | Meaning | First transition trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `draft` | Spec incomplete; child tasks not yet created | All placeholders filled; child tasks exist |
| `ready` | Fully specified; waiting for first task to start | First child task moves to `red` |
| `in-progress` | At least one child task active | — |
| `blocked` | All active tasks blocked | Blocker resolved → back to `in-progress` |
| `in-review` | All child tasks `done`; awaiting CI + review | CI green + human approves |
| `done` | CI gate passes; execution ledger updated | Terminal |
| `cancelled` | Abandoned with documented reason | Terminal |

> [!NOTE] This ticket opens in `draft`. The first agent obligation is to complete the spec and create all child `TASK-NNN` tickets before transitioning to `ready`.

## Workflow Log

> [!NOTE] Append-only. LLM agents add entries below in chronological order. Do not edit previous entries. Update the `status` frontmatter field to match the current state whenever adding an entry. See [[templates/tickets/lifecycle/feature-lifecycle]] for callout-type conventions and full transition rules.

> [!INFO] Opened — 2026-04-21
> Ticket created. Status: `draft`. Phase E4 VSIX Packaging and Local Verification feature defined; child tasks (TASK-147, TASK-148) and chore (CHORE-042) created. Blocked by FEAT-017 until Phase E3 is complete.
