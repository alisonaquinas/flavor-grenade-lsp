# Add coverage upload step (Codecov)

> [!INFO] `TASK-127` · Task · Phase 13 · Parent: [[FEAT-014]] · Status: `open`

## Description

Add a `codecov/codecov-action@v4` step to the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) immediately after the `bun test --coverage` step. The step must use `fail_ci_if_error: true` so that a Codecov upload failure blocks the CI run, and must read the `CODECOV_TOKEN` from GitHub Secrets (not from an environment variable directly in the workflow file).

---

## Implementation Notes

- Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` after `bun test --coverage`:

  ```yaml
  - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
    with:
      token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
      files: coverage/lcov.info
      fail_ci_if_error: true
  ```

- `CODECOV_TOKEN` must be stored as a GitHub repository secret, not hardcoded
- See also: [[requirements/ci-cd]], [[adr/ADR008-oidc-publishing]]

**Unblocks:**

- None

## Definition of Done

All of the following must be true before this task is marked `done`:

- [ ] Failing test(s) written first (RED commit exists in git log)
- [ ] Implementation written to make test(s) pass (GREEN commit follows)
- [ ] `bun run lint --max-warnings 0` passes
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` exits 0
- [ ] Coverage upload step present in CI YAML and CI run succeeds end-to-end
- [ ] [[test/matrix]] row(s) updated to `✅ passing`
- [ ] [[test/index]] row(s) added for new test files
- [ ] Parent feature [[FEAT-014]] child task row updated to `in-review`

---

## Notes

`fail_ci_if_error: true` ensures coverage regressions are visible immediately rather than silently skipped. If Codecov is not yet configured for the repository, this step should be added with `fail_ci_if_error: false` initially and switched once the token is set up.

## Lifecycle

Full state machine, TDD phase rules, and agent obligations: [[templates/tickets/lifecycle/task-lifecycle]]

**State path:** `open` → `red` → `green` → `refactor` _(optional)_ → `in-review` → `done`
**Lateral states:** `blocked` (from any active state, resumes to prior state), `cancelled`

> [!WARNING] `red` before `green` is non-negotiable. The failing test commit must precede the implementation commit in git history with no exceptions. See [[requirements/code-quality]] `Quality.TDD.StrictRedGreen`.

## Workflow Log

> [!NOTE] Append-only. LLM agents add entries below in chronological order. Do not edit previous entries. Update the `status` frontmatter field to match the current state whenever adding an entry. See [[templates/tickets/lifecycle/task-lifecycle]] for callout-type conventions and full transition rules.
